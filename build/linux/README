--How to build NoLifeStory on linux--

You will need:

- gcc > 4.6.1 (for adequate C++0x support)
	A lower version may do the job, but if it phails, don't blame me
- Most recent sfml2 version
	https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/tarball/master
- zlib
	http://zlib.net/ or check your distribution if it supplies the package

To actually build the thing:

go to "build/linux" and run "make"

!!If you are building on a 32 bit system, replace "lib/libbass64.so"
with "lib/libbass.so" in the Makefile!!

When you check out a new snapshot, run "make clean" before you build,
because the Makefile doesn't track header file dependencies!

Oh yeah, also, the project is in rapid development, so the Makefile might
be outdated. In that case, you will need to add the 
files that are missing from it yourself, until I update the Makefile.

kthxbye
